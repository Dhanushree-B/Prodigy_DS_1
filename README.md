Data Visualization with Bar Chart / Histogram
ðŸ“Š Task 01  
# Objective
To create a bar chart or histogram that visualizes the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable. This task aims to demonstrate foundational skills in data visualization using Python libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn.

# Dataset Source
A sample dataset was referenced from the World Bank Population Data, which includes population statistics across countries and years.

In this task, a sample dataset was simulated manually for demonstration purposes to avoid dependency on external files.

# Tools & Technologies
Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

# Visualizations Performed
Histogram of Age Distribution
Shows the frequency distribution of different age groups in a sample population.

Bar Chart of Gender Distribution
Illustrates the population count split by gender (Male vs Female).

# Key Features
Clean and minimal code for quick reproducibility

Inline visualizations for clarity

No need for external CSV or Excel files

# Sample Output
Age distribution histogram with KDE curve

Gender-based population bar chart with color differentiation

# How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/task01-population-visualization.git
Navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd task01-population-visualization
Run the Python script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python task01_visualization.py
Ensure that Python 3 and the required libraries (matplotlib, pandas, seaborn) are installed.

# Outcome
This task highlights the importance of using visualizations to understand data distributions, enabling better insights for analysis and reporting.
